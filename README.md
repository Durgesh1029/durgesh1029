## 💡 Key Personal Projects

Here are some of the key self-driven projects I have completed, demonstrating my skills in both VLSI design and data science.

### 1. Pipelined 32-bit MIPS Processor using Verilog HDL
* **Description:** Designed a fundamental computer architecture component to understand CPU operation.
* **Details:** Implemented a five-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) including data hazards and latches, and successfully validated its functionality using testbenches and timing diagrams.
* **Tags:** `#VerilogHDL` `#MIPSArchitecture` `#Pipelining`

### 2. CMOS Inverter Design and Analysis using GPDK 180nm
* **Description:** A core VLSI project focusing on fundamental transistor-level circuit design.
* **Details:** Designed and simulated a **CMOS inverter** in **Cadence Virtuoso** using GPDK 180nm technology, optimizing rise/fall times, and performing detailed DC/AC analysis to characterize its performance.
* **Tags:** `#VLSI` `#CadenceVirtuoso` `#AnalogDesign` `#GPDK180nm`

### 3. Implementation of Synchronous FIFO using Verilog HDL
* **Description:** Designed a common digital circuit used for efficient data buffering between systems.
* **Details:** Developed a **Synchronous FIFO** (First-In, First-Out) with clock-synchronized read/write pointers, essential for ensuring smooth data flow and preventing underflow/overflow conditions in digital systems.
* **Tags:** `#VerilogHDL` `#FIFO` `#DigitalDesign`

### 4. Design and Verification of 8-bit BCD Multiplier
* **Description:** Developed an arithmetic circuit that includes BCD conversion for display purposes.
* **Details:** Implemented an 8-bit Shift-and-Add multiplier incorporating the **Double Dabble** algorithm to accurately display results in both binary and BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) formats.
* **Tags:** `#VerilogHDL` `#BCD` `#ArithmeticCircuit`
